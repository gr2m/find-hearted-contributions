## Why?

As an Open Source project maintainer, I like to give shoutouts as part of a regular project update. For example, here is my updates issue for Octokit: [octokit/rest.js#620)](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js/issues/620). Here is a [comment containing a typical "Thanks" section](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js/issues/620#issuecomment-484601114).

But not all contributions are worthy a shoutout. Not all worthy contributions are code. It was quite time consuming to go through all contributions since the last update and find the ones I‚Äôd like to give a shout out for. So I started to use the ‚ù§Ô∏è reaction on issues, pull requests and comments as a way of boomarking the contributions for a later shoutout as I see them.

Digging out these hearted items turned out harder than I thought, so I wrote this CLI to help me with that from here on.

If you find it useful, please share where / how you use it üòä

## Usage

You must pass a GitHub personal authentication token. This project requires the "public_repo" scope for public repositories, "repo" scope for private repositories.

## Contributing

This is a very early version of something that I hope to become very useful for many maintainers out there. I‚Äôm open to any kind of contributions, be it ideas, code improvements, tests, or documentation.

Thanks!
